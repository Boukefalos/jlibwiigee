----------

**wiigee** is an open-source gesture recognition library for accelerometer-based gestures specifically developed for the Nintendo® Wii™ remote controller. It is implemented in [Java](http://www.java.com/en/)™ and, thus, is platform-independent. Using a third-party Bluetooth®-library wiigee allows you to define and recognize your own, freely trained gestures.

The wiigee library 

- allows you to **define (train) your own arbitrary gestures**,
- **recognizes these gestures** with high accuracy,
- offers an **event-driven architecture** with which you will be able to
- integrate the gesture-input as easy as common mouse-input.

**wiigee** utilizes state of the art probability theory-methods to deliver reliable results fast and efficient. Since it is still under development you are constantly invited to give feedback on your experience with the library and actively help to further improve it.
